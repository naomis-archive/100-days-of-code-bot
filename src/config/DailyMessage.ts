export const DailyMessage = `Heya <@&1108444569198137425>~! It is time for your daily 100 Days of Code posts!

- What did you spend your hour of coding time on?
- Did you learn anything cool?
- Did you run in to any issues?

If you have a blocker, post it here and perhaps a link to your question in ⁠⁠coding-forum so that we can help out.
(no social links, can't break the rules, GitHub is completely ok though!).

Don't forget to cheer on your fellow developers!`;
