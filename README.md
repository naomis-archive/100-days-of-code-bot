# 100 Days of Code Bot

This is a quick bot I slapped together for the Commit Your Code Discord community - the bot posts a daily reminder to share your 100 Days of Code progress and engage with others who are also on the learning journey.

## Live Version

View the bot in the [Commit Your Code](https://discord.gg/VCbuVMaFBp) Discord server.
